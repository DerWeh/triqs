Full example: Monte-Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model
===========================================================

The following example is the full implementation of a Monte-Carlo sampling of the magnetization of a 2D Ising model with statistical analysis.

For more information about the workings of the Monte-Carlo worker, we refer the reader to the :doc:`reference <../monte_carlo/contents>`.

.. This does not work in separate compilation:
.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/triqs/statistics/ising2d.cpp

The output is:

.. Nor does this, and this file doesn't exist:
.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/triqs/statistics/ising2d.output
